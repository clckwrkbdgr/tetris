Catris
------

Just like usual tetris, but each figure is a bunch of cats.
Should be .png image with all figures (multiplied by 4 rotated positions).
Also when lines are erased, there will be parts of original figure left (1, 2, 3 rows of each rotated position).

Features: pause, showing next block, colors (usual tetris colors), shadow (shows when block will be placed when its dropped).

Speeding up after each level, also need some score counting (different score for different counts of rows).
